# Battleship
This is a Battleship game. For detailed information about the Game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

It is programed in Python. The GUI is developed using Python's Open Source Library "Tkinter". I was asked to create a 2-D command line game for my CS Assignment but I love GUIs so I simply created the game as a GUI (gained extra credit for the effort!)
The game has several features:
     1. Player has 20 chances to find 4 hidden ships by simply clicking on the empty spaces.
     2.  Pressing on the same space, loses your chance
     3.  If you hit 4 ships, you win and after 20 chances and less than 4 hits you loose!
     4.  The program has a tracker to check for Ship hits and Chances. It also has a key of symbols.
Find the pictures of the game below, I can't share the code I submitted is at an assignment.
